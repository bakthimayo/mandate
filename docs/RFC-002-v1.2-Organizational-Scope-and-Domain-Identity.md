# RFC-002: Organizational Scope, Domain Identity & Governance Isolation (Non-SaaS)

**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** v1.2  
**Applies To:** Internal / On-Prem / Non-SaaS Deployments  
**Depends On:** RFC-001 (Control Plane & Decision Spec v1.1)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-06  

---

## 1. Abstract

This RFC defines how **Mandate** enforces **organizational isolation, domain identity, and scope-based governance** in a non-SaaS deployment.

It formalizes:
- Human-readable domain identity
- Scope as the authoritative governance anchor
- Deterministic isolation between domains and teams
- Audit-safe attribution of authority for every verdict

This RFC intentionally avoids SaaS tenancy concerns and focuses on **internal enterprise governance correctness**.

---

## 2. Motivation

Mandate is expected to operate across:
- Multiple business domains (Finance, HR, Logistics, etc.)
- Multiple services and AI agents
- Multiple teams with independent governance authority

Without explicit domain and scope modeling:
- Policies may bleed across teams
- Accountability becomes unclear
- Audit explanations lose credibility
- Governance decisions become politically ambiguous

RFC-002 ensures Mandate scales **organizationally before it scales technically**.

---

## 3. Core Concepts

### 3.1 Organization

An **Organization** represents the top-level governance boundary.

Rules:
- Exactly one organization exists in non-SaaS v1
- `organization_id` MUST be explicitly provided
- `organization_id` MUST be a UUID
- Organization boundaries are logical, not infrastructural

The organization is a **security and isolation boundary**, not a governance explanation primitive.

---

### 3.2 Domain (Normative)

A **Domain** represents a human-defined governance boundary within the organization.

Examples:
- `finance`
- `hr`
- `logistics`
- `compliance`

#### Domain Identity Rules

- Domains MUST be identified by a **string slug**
- Domains MUST NOT use UUIDs or surrogate identifiers
- Domains MUST be referenced by name, not ID
- Domain values MUST be stable and human-readable

Domains appear in:
- policy reasoning
- audit explanations
- UI filters
- incident reviews

> **If an identifier must be explained to an auditor, it MUST NOT be a UUID.**

---

### 3.3 Scope (Authoritative Governance Anchor)

A **Scope** represents an organizational authority boundary under which governance decisions are valid.

Scope hierarchy:

```
Organization → Domain → Service → Agent
```

#### Scope Identifier

- `scope_id` MUST be a **human-readable string**
- `scope_id` MUST embed the domain
- `scope_id` MUST be immutable once created
- UUID-based scope identifiers are forbidden

Example:

```
finance.prod.billing.db-admin
```

This identifier must remain stable for the lifetime of all decisions that reference it.

---

## 4. Scope Ownership

Every scope MUST declare ownership metadata:

- `owning_team` (required)
- `owner_contact` (optional)
- `description` (optional)

Ownership is used for:
- audit explanations
- escalation routing
- incident investigation

Ownership does NOT grant enforcement authority.

---

## 5. Decision Spec Binding

Decision Specs (RFC-001) are **domain-bound**.

Rules:
- A spec belongs to exactly one organization
- A spec belongs to exactly one domain
- A spec resolved for one domain MUST NOT be reused in another domain

Spec resolution MUST include:
- organization_id
- domain
- intent
- stage

---

## 6. Policy Binding Rules

Policies are executable governance rules and MUST be explicitly bound.

Each policy MUST reference:
- exactly one `spec_id`
- exactly one `scope_id`

Rules:
- Policies MUST NOT span multiple domains
- Policies MUST NOT reference multiple specs
- Policies MUST NOT apply outside their scope

This prevents accidental policy bleed.

---

## 7. Signal Population from Unstructured Context (Normative)

During the Observe phase, Mandate MAY derive signal values from unstructured
context (e.g., AI-generated text responses) in order to populate declared
Decision Spec signals.

This process:
- Produces values only for signals explicitly declared in the Decision Spec
- Occurs prior to Decision Spec and Scope resolution
- Does not introduce new signals or modify signal definitions

Signal population MUST:
- Avoid semantic understanding or factual verification
- Avoid policy interpretation or verdict inference
- Treat any assisted (e.g., LLM-based) derivation as non-authoritative

Assisted derivation MAY be used only to populate context-sourced signals and
MUST NOT reduce risk classification or authorize permissive outcomes.

All governance decisions remain exclusively based on declared signals,
resolved specs, resolved scopes, and bound policies.

At decision evaluation time:

1. Resolve Decision Spec (RFC-001)
2. Resolve Scope (RFC-002)
3. Select policies where:
   - policy.spec_id == spec.spec_id
   - policy.scope_id matches decision attribution
4. Evaluate policies
5. Resolve verdict severity (BLOCK > PAUSE > ALLOW > OBSERVE)

Any mismatch MUST result in safe evaluation failure.

---

## 8. Decision Attribution (Strict)

Every DecisionEvent MUST include:
- organization_id
- domain
- intent
- stage

Missing attribution:
- MUST fail evaluation safely
- MUST default verdict to OBSERVE
- MUST record an audit explanation

Inference of missing fields is forbidden.

---

## 9. Isolation Guarantees

Mandate MUST guarantee:

- No cross-domain policy application
- No cross-spec policy application
- No cross-scope authority leakage
- Deterministic and explainable verdicts

Violation of these guarantees invalidates the control plane model.

---

## 10. Observability & Audit Requirements

Every VerdictEvent MUST record:

- spec_id
- spec_version
- scope_id
- domain
- owning_team

Audit timelines MUST be sufficient to answer:

> “Why was this decision allowed or blocked, and under whose authority?”

---

## 11. Migration Rule (Normative)

If a system previously used `domain_id` (UUID):

- `domain_id` MUST be removed
- `domain_name` MUST become canonical `domain`
- All historical records MUST preserve domain meaning
- UUID-based domain identifiers MUST NOT remain

---

## 12. Non-Goals

This RFC does NOT define:
- SaaS tenancy or billing
- Authentication or IAM
- Workflow orchestration
- Policy authoring UX

These concerns require separate RFCs.

---

## 13. Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

1. `organization_id` is a UUID
2. `domain` is a human-readable string
3. `scope_id` is a structured, human-readable string
4. Specs are domain-bound
5. Policies are spec- and scope-bound
6. Verdicts permanently record scope authority

---

## 14. Summary

RFC-002 establishes **organizational truth** in Mandate.

Specs define **what** may be decided.  
Domains define **which business area governs**.  
Scopes define **where authority applies**.  
Policies define **how decisions are evaluated**.

Together, they ensure Mandate is:
- auditable
- explainable
- enterprise-safe
- future-proof
